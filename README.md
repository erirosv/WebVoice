# VoiceApp
Playing aorund with a p-2-p javascript library.

Voice App is a simple application build with HTML and peer-to-peer js.

## Work
The page will display two buttons. One of the buttons will generate a ```peer ID```. You send the ```peer ID``` to a friend who paste it in in their running varsion of the page in the second box ```Answer```.

Hopefully the connection works and you can talk to each other.

**NOTE** this do not always work. This is only a demo of what is possible to be build with this library.
